Most of the threading problems are
generally of the category of Producer
consumer pattern where one thread is
producing data and other thread consume
that data.
We must know how to establish
intercommunication between
threads to solve this problem.
In this example program, wait() and notify() methods are
called inside deliver() and receive() method.
Both methods enable Thread1 to notify Thread2 after producing
data and wait until Thread2 complete using.
In the same way, Thread2 after using data notifies
Thread1 and waits until Thread1 produces and delivers
the next data. Thus, the output comes in a synchronized form.
